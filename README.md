# csce3110_group_project

⚠️ **This project is currently written in TypeScript and requires the TypeScript compiler to properly build.**

⚠️ **This project is currently written in C++ and requires clang, g++, or other C++ standard compiler to build.**

## Typescript Instructions

The ll.js file produced by the Typescript compiler is included in this repository.

If `npm` and `node` are not already installed, they can be installed via [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

```sh
npm install
node ll.js
```

## C++ Instructions

Either the gcc or clang compiler collections must be installed.

```sh
g++ bst.cpp -o bst
./bst
```

## Project Requirements

> **We must use two different data structures.**
>
> 1. Linked List
>
> 2. Binary Search Tree
> Requirements:
> 
> **You must have the following features implemented.**
>
> 1. add a student to the existing database.
>
> 2. Delete a student from the database once the student ID is given
>
> 3. search for a student with an ID
>
> 4. Search for a student with a name in case the student ID is not available
>
> 5. update student records when the student ID is given. This feature must allow the user to see the current information and a chance to modify any information except student ID.
> Insert 100,000 students into the system. You can use a faker library to generate a list of students. 
>
> One possible candidate is https://github.com/cieslarmichal/faker-cxx
>
> Links to an external site.
>
> Use this library to create a list of fake students with the following information
>
> Name: The first name is enough
>
> DOB:
>
> Address: street
>
> Address: city
>
> Address: State
>
> Address: zip
>
> You may use other faker libraries, such as Python libraries, write them to a file, and later read it into a C++ program.
>
> Python Faker: https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/
>
> You must provide the answers to the following questions.
>
> 1. What is the run time of each operation (1 to 5 given above)for the Linked List and Binary Search tree?
>
> 2. Make a comparison between Linked List and Binary Search Tree.
>
>
>
> 
>
> Submission guidelines:
>
> 1. Submit your code as a zipped file. 
>
> 2. Document your system. Include some screenshots that display the five features that you implemented. Submit this doc file along side of your code file.
